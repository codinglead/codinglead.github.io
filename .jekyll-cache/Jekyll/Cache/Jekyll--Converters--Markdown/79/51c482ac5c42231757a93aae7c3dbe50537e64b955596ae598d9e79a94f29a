I"n<p>Recently I had to load many images with part of the URL coming from an API and display them on the home page. With Create-React-App you can not just do a relative path you have to load them in using <code class="highlight__code">require()</code> or <code class="highlight__code">import</code> because it will tells webpack to include that file in the bundle.</p>
