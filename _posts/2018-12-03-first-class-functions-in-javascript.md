First class functions are first class citizens which mean they are treated like any other variable.

## Functions are treated the same way as objects

Functions can be assigned to variables, assigned as array values, and assigned as object values. Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions. Functions can be returned from functions.

## allows for the creation of higher-order functions

A higher order function either takes one or more function as arguments or returns a function.

some examples of higher order functions

map(), filter(), reduce()


happy coding :)
