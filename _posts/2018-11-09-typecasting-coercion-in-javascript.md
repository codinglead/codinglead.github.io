Typecasting doesn't exist in javascript. There is type coercion which is changing a value to another type. You can do it implicitly and explicitly. Implicit coercion plays a huge role when using double equals when comparing values.

## explicit vs implicit coercion

Explicit coercion is telling JavaScript to change the type. Implicit coercion is not telling JavaScript to change the type directly.

```javascript
var x = 42;
var explicit = String(x) // "42"
var implicit = x + ""; // "42"
```

When changing 42 explicitly to a string we used one of the object wrappers to do it. When changing 42 implicitly we added a double quote to the number and JavaScript figured out that you want to change the type to a string.

## == vs ===

In JavaScript you can compare values using the double equals or triple equals.

* == coerces the type
* === requires equivalent types

The problem with double equal is what you expect to happen might not happen. You have to be a master at coercion to fully utilize the double equal and everyone else reading your code as well needs to have a good understanding on type coercion. If you know what the types will be, use double equals when in doubt use triple equals.

## what values are falsy

A Falsy value is when doing a comparison what values will be translated to false.

* false
* +0, -0, NaN
* ""
* undefined
* null

## what values are truthy

what is a truthy values?

A Truthy value is when doing a comparison which values will be translated to true.

* {}
* []
* everything else

happy coding :)
